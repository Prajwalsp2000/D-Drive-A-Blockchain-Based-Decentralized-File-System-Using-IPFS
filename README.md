# D-Drive-A-Blockchain-Based-Decentralized-File-System-Using-IPFS

• Traditional centralized cloud storage systems, though widely used, are often insecure and lack confidentiality due to third-party control. To address these challenges, we propose D-Drive, a new file storage         system based on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and blockchain technology.

• Users can upload, store, and share files within a peer-to-peer network on a blockchain-based file system that ensures confidentiality and integrity.

• Fine-grained access control is achieved through smart contracts, allowing users to grant or revoke access to other Ethereum accounts.

• Integrated with MetaMask and Ganache, the system performs Ether-based transactions for file operations.

• Real-time transaction notifications enhance user trust and transparency.
